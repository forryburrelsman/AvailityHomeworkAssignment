1. Tell me about your proudest professional achievement. 
It can also be a personal or school project.


I am currently working on the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline as a Crisis Chatline Worker, 
and I have found guiding people through crisis to be professionally and emotionally challenging 
and fulfilling. Recently, I decided to take two chats at the same time as it was a busy night 
on the line. One chatter I was talking to was a teenager who was experiencing a lot of fear due 
to her mental health crisis. The other chatter was a young adult reaching out on behalf of their 
mom who was having a difficult time. Both chatters were experiencing incredibly intense 
distress, and looking to me to quickly provide resources and coping techniques to help them 
keep themselves and their loved ones safe. I am really proud to say that I helped both chatters 
stay safe and start feeling a little better. Because every conversation on the crisis line is 
unique and they can go in unexpected directions, doing this work requires a unique kind of 
problem solving, creativity, and quick analysis. It was empowering and fulfilling to know that, 
by having these conversations, these individuals felt a little bit calmer, more supported, and 
more hopeful than when they had when they first reached out.
