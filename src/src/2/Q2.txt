2. Tell me about something you have read recently that you would recommend and why. 
(Can be a Github Repo, Article, Blog, Book, etc)


I have been reading Code by Charles Petzold recently and have found it to be useful in 
helping me shift my perspective. I usually read this book in pieces during times when I’ve 
been working on a coding project for a long time and need to take a breather. In these moments,
I am grateful that picking up this book allows me to stay within the realm of code and logical
thinking but in a slightly different capacity than my projects do. Code explores the theories,
logic, and history of code, which helps reignite my enthusiasm when I’m feeling drained or 
frustrated with my current project. This book provides me with the big picture perspective of
coding, which aligns well with my tendency to want to zoom out and ask “why.” I recommend 
Code to anyone with an interest in the foundational logic behind code or the evolution of 
technology.
