3. How would you explain to your grandmother what Availity does?


Grandma, I'm interviewing for a new job at a company called Availity. You can think of them 
as the middle man between HealthCare Providers, Hospitals, and Insurance Companies. 
They create computer programs so all the communication between those three parties can happen
online instead of on paper. It speeds up and smooths out the process.

For example, when you go to your primary care doctor, and they refer you to a physical 
therapist, there's several steps that need to happen in the background before, during, and 
after your appointments with that specialist. These steps include finding a PT that your 
insurance covers, getting approval from all parties about your need for the PT, submitting 
a claim for services provided, and keeping your info updated so these processes continue to 
work efficiently.

All of these background processes ensure the payments between your insurance company and 
your healthcare providers go smoothly so you don't have to worry about it.
